## Day 1

- Simple operation on 2 arrays, simply sort them first
- For the second half, use two pointers method. Not sure if needed, but surely a bit faster.

## Day 2

- Instead of going with overly complicate if-else conditions, just brute force the heck out of it.

## Day 3

- Finally learn how to use `regex`
- The `don't` flag doesn't reset by the end of each line, which sucks by the way.
- Simply put everything in a single line to avoid coming up with another solution

## Day 4

It's so easy that I don't know what to write here. Just a bunch of if-else statements are enough `:))`
